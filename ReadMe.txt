This tool has two bits of functionality.  

The first one counts the lines of code in your app.  I know VSS will do this for you, but it only counts the lines of code for one file at a time, so if you have an app with 20 files then that can get pretty anoying.  Also, VSS will count all the metadata that defines the controls on a .frm file (open a .frm in notepad to see what i mean).  This will give a false sense of the coding effert that went into the app.  This tool gives counts all the code in .frm, .bas, .cls, .dsr and .ctl files (its easy to add a new file type if i missed one) for an application.  It also breaks down the line count into number of blank lines, number of commented lines, number of lines with actual code and a total of all three.

The second one is a string search functionality to search vb files for a specific text string.  This is usefull if you have, like me, a code library of about 40 apps and need to find a code example that you remember you did about 6 months ago, but cant remember what project it was in.  you can enter the snipit of code that your remember, and the tool will search a folder for that string.  It cal also search sub-folders if you want to with a neat little recursive function (i love recursion!).

This tool uses the file system object to do the majority of file manipulation.  one thing to keep in mind, MS broke interfact of the file system object dll (scrrun.dll) when they made IE 5.0 so if your running an IE version less than 5.0 you will probably have to recompile the exe before it will work because i compiled it against the new interface.
